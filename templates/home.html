Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting are used to achieve accurate predictions. <br/><br/> This model helps users compare prices in advance and make cost-effective travel decisions. It is deployed as a web application using Flask, providing real-time price predictions through a user-friendly interface..</p>

                    <p id="para1">This project implements a web-based conversational chatbot using Google’s Gemini large language model. <br/><br/> The system follows a client–server architecture where the frontend captures user queries and sends them to the backend through HTTP requests. The backend integrates the Gemini API to process natural language input and generate context-aware responses. <br/><br/> Proper request handling, prompt formatting, and API authentication are implemented to ensure secure and efficient communication. The chatbot responses are returned in JSON format and dynamically rendered on the web interface. This project provides hands-on experience with RESTful APIs, asynchronous communication, prompt engineering, and AI model integration </p>

                        This movie review prediction project is based on machine learning and natural language processing techniques. <br/><br/> The main objective of this project is to analyze movie reviews given by users and predict whether the sentiment of the review is positive or negative. The system first preprocesses the text by removing unwanted symbols, stop words, and converting text into a suitable numerical format. Then, a classification algorithm is trained using labeled movie review data. After training, the model can accurately predict the sentiment of new user reviews. <br/><br/> This project helps students understand important NLP concepts such as text cleaning, feature extraction, and model training. It also provides hands-on experience in building and deploying a real-world machine learning application.</p>
